Subject: Data Quality Issues & Next Steps for Users, Brands, and Receipts

Hi [Business Stakeholderâ€™s Name],

I hope you are doing well. After reviewing the Users, Brands, and Receipts datasets, I have identified several key data quality issues 
that need attention. Below is a summary:

Data Quality Issues

1. Missing Values
Receipts: topBrand, state, bonusPointsEarned, pointsEarned, purchasedItemCount
Users: state, signUpSource, lastLogin
Brands: barcode, brandCode, categoryCode

2. Inconsistencies and Formatting Issues
Duplicate Data: categoryCode duplicates category.
MongoDB Format: _id, cpg, and timestamps appear to be in MongoDB format, making queries inefficient.
Date and Time Format: createDate, lastLogin, etc., should be converted to DATETIME.
Unexpected Values: role contains unexpected values: fetch-staff.

Questions
Are these datasets sourced from MongoDB?
Are barcode values unique across records?
Why are transactional fields (e.g., pointsEarned, bonusPointsEarned) missing?

Please find my next steps and recommendations below:

Standardize Key Fields: Extract _id, store it as VARCHAR(24), and convert timestamps to DATETIME.
Handle Missing Values: Define default values ex: "UNKNOWN" or flag missing records.
Optimize Performance: Instead of storing receipt items within the rewardsReceiptItemList field, 
create a separate table for this information and enforce barcode uniqueness.

I would love to discuss further. Let me know if you would like to set up a quick call to review these findings.

Best regards,
Shaun Lin
