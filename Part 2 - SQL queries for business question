Using MySQL to answer at least two predetermined business question

1- What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?

WITH recent_month AS (
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(MAX(date_scanned), '%Y-%m') AS recent_month
    FROM receipts
)

SELECT 
    b.name AS brand_name, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.receipt_id) AS total_receipts
FROM receipts r
JOIN receipt_items ri 
ON r.receipt_id = ri.receipt_id
JOIN items i 
ON ri.item_id = i.item_id
JOIN brand b 
ON i.brand_id = b.brand_id
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(r.date_scanned, '%Y-%m') = (SELECT recent_month FROM recent_month)
GROUP BY b.name
ORDER BY total_receipts DESC
LIMIT 5


2 - When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

SELECT 
    rewards_receipt_status, 
    AVG(total_spent) AS avg_spend
FROM receipts
WHERE rewards_receipt_status IN ('Accepted', 'Rejected')
GROUP BY rewards_receipt_status
ORDER BY avg_spend DESC
LIMIT 1


3 - Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?

WITH recent_users AS (
    SELECT user_id 
    FROM users
    WHERE created_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
)
SELECT 
    b.brand_name, 
    SUM(r.total_spent) AS total_spend
FROM receipts AS r
JOIN recent_users AS u  -- Use the CTE directly in the FROM clause
ON r.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN receipt_items AS ri 
ON r.receipt_id = ri.receipt_id
JOIN items AS i 
ON ri.item_id = i.item_id
JOIN brand AS b 
ON i.brand_id = b.brand_id
GROUP BY b.brand_name
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 1
